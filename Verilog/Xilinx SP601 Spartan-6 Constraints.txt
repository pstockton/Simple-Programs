======================================
Basic constraints for Xilinx SP601 Spartan-6 FPGA
======================================

A. create the constraints file
LEDs: E13 C14 C4 A4
DIP Sw: D14 E12 F12 V13
Push Buttons: B0 = P4, B1 = F6, B2 = E4, B3 = F5
Clock: NET "<variable>" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = TRUE;


ufc syntax:
NET "<variable>" LOC = "<location>";

B. run Generate Programming File
C. Connect board with usb to JTAG.
	wait for the computer to install the driver
D. Configure Target Device |
	Boundary Scan
	right click | Add Xilinx device
	select .bit file
E. Right click on device | Program



Ex. test OR gate, NAND gate
Ex. add two 2-bit numbers. First 2 DIP switches as first number,
	next 2 DIP SW as seocnd number. Show answer in the leds
	as binary.
Ex. Gray in DIP SW to BCD in LEDs
